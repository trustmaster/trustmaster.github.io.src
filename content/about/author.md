Hello world! My name is Vladimir, an Engineering Manager, Software Engineer, and a slow and lazy writer. I have Master degree in Computer Science and background in Content Management Systems, Web Development Agencies, and Product Engineering from small start-ups to large global scale-ups.

## Interests

Currently I write mostly about:

- Managing Software Engineering teams
- Building complex systems with a flow-based mindset
- Coaching and productivity

You can find some of my older posts on this site about:

 - Building and maintaining backends with Node.js and NoFlo
 - Practical use of Flow-based Programming in software architecture and implementation in Go and JavaScript
 - Technical leadership in small teams and keeping agile projects on full sail
 - Full-stack web application engineering

## Bio

I began programming at school in 2001, an experience that sparked a lifelong passion for creating things with code. My journey started with graphics programming and an early open-source project in FreePascal. For over a decade, I specialized in the LAMP stack, which led me to freelance work and eventually to founding my own development agency, [Kodigy](http://kodigy.com/), in 2008.

My Master's Thesis focused on applying Systems Analysis and Flow-based Programming to software engineering, a theme that has followed me throughout my career. I also led the open-source CMS project [Cotonti](https://www.cotonti.com/) for several years.

After running my agency, I took a role as Director of Engineering at a digital production company. This first taste of management made me realize I wanted to deepen my technical expertise, so I returned to a hands-on role as a Software Engineer at [The Grid](https://thegrid.io), a pioneer in AI-designed websites (back in 2014!). There, I had the unique opportunity to work with Flow-based systems in a large-scale production environment.

When my time at The Grid ended, I moved to Berlin and joined [HelloFresh](https://www.hellofresh.com/) as a Backend Engineer. I grew with the company as it scaled from a 150-person tech team to over 1000, taking on roles as a Technical Program Manager and eventually an Engineering Manager. In my leadership role at HelloFresh, I built and led multiple autonomous teams, delivered customer-facing features across the full stack, and mentored dozens of engineers in their careers.

Currently I'm leading a team that tames the power and weirdness of Generative AI to generate real business impact at a global scale, as part of Delivery Hero group.

## Offtopic

Behind the scenes, I'm a family guy who loves his family, enjoys cooking, good food and good music (hit me up, audiophiles out there!). I also travel a bit and do some travel photography, you can check out some examples in my [Photo blog](https://photos.kodigy.com/).

I had been maintaining my collection of MODs, ITs, MP3s, OGGs and FLACs for somewhat 18 years. But it didn't change much recently, and I wanted to find better ways of discovering music. When I finally started to search for a music streaming service, my list of requirements looked like this:

- Competitive music database
- Multiple platforms and devices: Mac, Android, iOS
- Easy to discover new music of all kinds (not tied to specific genre/country)
- Easy to maintain My Library
- Lossless quality

Of course I started with the most popular option out here, Spotify. It's rather convenient but the last bullet is a miss. 320kbps OGG is good for listening on a phone on the go, but for stationary audition it's not comparable to 1411kbps FLAC.

So, I went for a 30 days free trial of Tidal HiFi and after a month I decided to stay on this pricey tier.

## Music choice and discovery, apps

The music database is surprisingly good. It contains all the fundamentals like Radiohead, Muse, Tiesto, etc. It has the recent albums as well as the oldies. It even has rare stuff like Jogeir Liljedahl, Future Crew and The Scientist. The only and obvious flaw here is that it doesn't have _all_ the music. Some artists are represented by very few albums.

The interface looks modern and is fine to use. The search is not so convenient as Spotify's. Using the sidebar for search isn't the best UX idea on Earth, and on mobile it's even worse. But it's tolerable.

Tidal doesn't have automatic recommendations based on your personal preferences. But last time I tried this feature in Deezer for example, it was disgusting: it kept ignoring my taste and played vanilla sweet Pop and backstreet Russian Rap instead. Maybe it's not such a big thing to loose.

The front page is a bit useless to me, it would be nice to have it more personalized. So I usually go straight to Search, Playlists or My Library.

The existing playlists are selected rather finely by the Tidal editors. The problem is the choice of genres and moods, which is very limited. Overall, the playlists are not very many.

The apps are just OK. The desktop one is far ahead in terms of features and convenience. I've experienced pretty annoying playback freezes on iOS, but apart from that the mobile apps are also OK.

So far it sounds like a pretty average experience. What makes Tidal a really good choice then?

## Streaming quality

The focus on quality remains the killer feature that is hard to beat. You don't only get lossless streams on desktop, you can also listen to them on mobile devices (and set which quality you want on a specific device, so that the mobile Internet package doesn't blow up).

Is it really streaming 1411kbps FLACs? Comparing to lossy streams, it sounds like it. But there's even more.

### MQA

Tidal comes with this highly arguable technology called [MQA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Quality_Authenticated). There are a lot of articles on the Internet about it, with 50% of them telling how good it is, and another 50% telling that it's a scam or a plot against the artists.

In a nutshell, MQA is supposed to help music services like Tidal stream the source collection of Hi-Res 24bit/96KHz files on almost the same bandwidth as standard 16bit/44.1Khz FLAC. Of course, the laws of entropy cannot be broken, and it means that the MQA codec is "lossy" in some way. But it's lossy compared to 24bit/96KHz vinyls, not to CD quality.

The main criticism against MQA is about two things.

The first is about the quality. It's claimed that MQA-encoded files are not worth the promised 24bit depth and are comparable with 18bit plain FLACs. And that for non-MQA devices this extra data only results into high frequency noise. I can see how this is true in theory and numbers, but for sensual experience read a couple paragraphs below.

The second thing is that this is a proprietary codec designed to charge money from all the participants: the artists, the recording companies, the streaming services, and eventually the listeners. With this I cannot agree more and I would love to see an open technology that targets Hi-Res streaming to dominate the market and rid the world from money-thirsty MQA, just like FLAC has done before. This is not the case right now, though.

But what does it mean in the end to me as a listener of Tidal MQA streams?

Hell yeah, MQA makes a big difference compared to the standard CD quality streaming. It really brings more crispness and detail to the sound. The difference is especially sensible if you listen to it with an MQA-enabled DAC. Fortunately, I've recently become an owner of one. Otherwise there's still an option of built-in software decoder, but with software decoding the difference with a normal CD stream is not so obvious.

To be precise, Tidal's Master streams are claimed to be 24bit/48KHz. My DAC recognizes them as 44.1KHz though and I tend to trust the hardware more than the streamer's copywriters. Be it still 18bit/44.1KHz worth of FLAC in the end, I can still hear the difference. To me this is the selling point.

## The rivals

If Spotify provided the same quality on its HiFi tier, I would definitely prefer that, because it has bigger collection and better apps. But its HiFi beta is looking abandoned right now, so there isn't much choice. My earlier experience with Deezer was so bad I don't want to waste time on it again. And I'm not French so I can't Qobuz.

So I stay with Tidal's imperfectness for now.
